           <h2>Dream Of Mine</h2>
           <h3>Become World's No 1 Web developer </h3>
           <p>Web development is a uniquely positioned skill-based field, where there are many successful specialists that don't have any formal education in the area. Self-learning or educational courses have consistently proven to be valuable options, while professional certificates may help acknowledge your efforts.</p>

         <p>However, there is also the harsh reality that many employers today still require prospective wed developers to hold a relevant bachelor degree, which may be in computer science or something similar. Relevant subjects include programming, advanced mathematics, web design, networking and database management.</p>

           <p>Web engineering is an emerging new discipline, where specialists work to implement a systematic approach to web development. This is extremely important, considering that there are currently no solid guidelines for best practices in web development, as well as no quality control and assurance procedures.</p>
